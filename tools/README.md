# Tools folder

Repository utility scripts are grouped here to keep the project root cleaner.

- `check-no-functions.js`: checks for disallowed `functions/` imports/usages in client code.
- `convert-misnamed-webp.js`: converts and normalizes misnamed image assets.
- `maintenance/`: one-off maintenance and patch helper scripts.
