            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p><strong>Last Updated: November 25, 2023</strong></p>
            <p>SecondHandCell ("SecondHandCell," "we," "us," or "our") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes the types of personal information we collect, how we use and share it, and the choices you have when you interact with our website, quoting tools, customer communications, and other services (collectively, the "Services").</p>

            <h2>1. Scope</h2>
            <p>This policy applies to information we collect online through secondhandcell.com and our mobile web experiences, as well as information you provide when you contact us, create an account, request a shipping kit, or complete a transaction. It does not apply to third-party sites or services that link to or from our Services.</p>

            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We collect information in the following categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contact and account details</strong> such as your name, email address, phone number, mailing address, and account credentials.</li>
                <li><strong>Transaction details</strong> including device descriptions, serial or IMEI numbers, condition assessments, quotes, offer history, and payout selections.</li>
                <li><strong>Payment information</strong> required to send your payout (for example, ACH, PayPal, Venmo, or Zelle identifiers). We do not permanently store full bank or card numbers on our servers.</li>
                <li><strong>Communications</strong> including emails, chat messages, and customer support interactions.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical information</strong> such as IP address, browser type, device identifiers, and usage data collected through cookies or similar technologies.</li>
                <li><strong>Compliance information</strong> such as government-issued identification numbers or proofs of ownership you voluntarily provide to verify transactions when required by law.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. How We Collect Information</h2>
            <p>We collect information directly from you when you submit forms or communicate with us, automatically through cookies and analytics tools, and from third parties such as payment processors, shipping carriers, identity verification vendors, or publicly available databases used to validate device status.</p>

            <h2>4. How We Use Information</h2>
            <p>We use personal information to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide, personalize, and improve the Services, including generating quotes and processing orders.</li>
                <li>Communicate with you about your order status, required actions, support requests, promotions, and policy updates.</li>
                <li>Process payments and issue payouts.</li>
                <li>Authenticate your identity, prevent fraud, and comply with secondhand dealer and anti-theft obligations.</li>
                <li>Maintain business records, conduct analytics, and improve our operations.</li>
                <li>Send marketing emails or SMS messages when you opt in (you may unsubscribe at any time).</li>
                <li>Enforce our <a href="terms.html">Terms &amp; Conditions</a> and protect our rights, property, and customers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. How We Share Information</h2>
            <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share it with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Service providers</strong> that perform services on our behalf, such as shipping carriers, payment processors, email service providers, cloud hosting partners, analytics vendors, and customer support platforms.</li>
                <li><strong>Business partners or law enforcement</strong> when we are required to report or hold devices that may be lost or stolen, or to comply with subpoenas, court orders, or legal obligations.</li>
                <li><strong>Professional advisors</strong> such as lawyers, auditors, or insurers as needed for compliance and risk management.</li>
                <li><strong>In connection with a business transfer</strong> if we explore or complete a merger, financing, or sale of all or part of our business.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
            <p>We and our analytics partners use cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies to understand how visitors use the Services, remember your preferences, and improve performance. You can adjust browser settings to refuse cookies, but doing so may impact functionality. We do not respond to “Do Not Track” signals at this time.</p>

            <h2>7. Payment Processing</h2>
            <p>Payouts may be issued through third-party payment providers. Those providers collect and process your payment credentials subject to their own privacy policies. We maintain only the minimum information necessary to reference the transaction.</p>

            <h2>8. Device Data Handling</h2>
            <p>Devices accepted for purchase are subjected to a certified, multi-step data erasure process. If a device cannot be cleared because of an activation lock or lost/stolen status, we isolate it and follow legal reporting requirements. We recommend backing up and wiping your device before shipping it to us.</p>

            <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We retain personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this policy, comply with recordkeeping laws for secondhand dealers, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. When information is no longer needed, we securely delete or anonymize it.</p>

            <h2>10. Security</h2>
            <p>We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect personal information against unauthorized access, destruction, loss, or alteration. No system can be guaranteed 100% secure, so please use caution when transmitting information online.</p>

            <h2>11. Your Choices &amp; Rights</h2>
            <p>You may update your contact information, change communication preferences, or request deletion of your account by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@secondhandcell.com">support@secondhandcell.com</a>. You can opt out of marketing emails by using the unsubscribe link in those messages.</p>

            <h2>12. State-Specific Privacy Rights</h2>
            <p>Depending on where you live, you may have additional rights to access, correct, or delete personal information, or to opt out of certain processing. To exercise those rights, please email us with “Privacy Request” in the subject line and include details that help us verify your identity. We will respond in accordance with applicable law.</p>

            <h2>13. Children’s Privacy</h2>
            <p>The Services are not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we learn that we have collected information from a child, we will delete it promptly.</p>

            <h2>14. Third-Party Links</h2>
            <p>Our Services may contain links to third-party websites or services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites. We encourage you to review their policies before providing information.</p>

            <h2>15. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the “Last Updated” date at the top of this page. Material changes will be communicated through the Services or via email when required by law. Your continued use of the Services after an update means you accept the revised policy.</p>

            <h2>16. Contact Us</h2>
